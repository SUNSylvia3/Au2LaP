# Au2LaP: Automated Descriptor Selection Enhanced 2D Material Layer Group Predictor

Crystal symmetry is a fundamental aspect of material properties and plays a pivotal role in the discovery and design of new materials. **Au2LaP** (Automated Descriptor Selection Enhanced 2D Material Layer Group Predictor) is the first machine learning framework specifically designed to predict **layer groups** of two-dimensional (2D) materials directly from their chemical composition.

---

## 🌟 Key Features
- 🎯 **Layer Group Prediction**: Accurately predicts layer groups for 2D materials using only chemical composition.
- 🤖 **Automated Descriptor Selection**: Integrates LightGBM and SHAP to optimize predictive accuracy and interpretability.
- 📈 **Explainable AI**: Offers insights by identifying the most significant chemical descriptors contributing to predictions.
- 🧩 **Polymorph Structure Prediction**: Facilitates polymorph studies by predicting multiple possible layer groups for given compositions.
